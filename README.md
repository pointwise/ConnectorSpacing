ConnectorSpacing
===============
This script is a tool for making the grid spacing around the perimeter of the selected domain consistent with its neighboring domains. As shown in the image of the script's user interface, you are given three sets of options.

1. Which spacings are to be averaged
    * Ones on the connectors in the selected domain
    * Ones on the connectors in the selected domain's neighbors
    * All spacings on connectors in the selected domain and its neighbors
2. Where the average spacing is to be applied
    * On the connectors in the selected domain
    * On connectors in the neighboring domains
    * On connectors in the selected domain and its neighbors
3. Whether or not to include spacing at break points (as opposed to only spacings at nodes)
